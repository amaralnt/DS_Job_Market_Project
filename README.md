# Data Science Job Market Project

Data Science is a fast-growing field, with more than 2.7 million new data jobs predicted to be created. 

This project aims to explore all the features of a dataset covering various aspects of the Data Science Job Market. Here, I clean, filter, format, analyze, and visualize the data. The tools I used were Excel, with PivotTables and PivotCharts, and Python, with wordcloud and matplotlib.
